# spoof_portals

- This is a dirty code for bypassing captive portals by mac spoofing methods.
- In modern wifi environment, the wireless AP block our scanning probes and we can't reach to other targets. 
- But we can see the other host traffic by changing our network card to passive mode.
- Using wireshark, we can collect the mac of other hosts. And save to mac.txt.
- Adjust some values from script and run the script.

Cheers!
